		<p>
			Student inc. is a company developed in 2018 that offers students computers that 
			are suitable for their lessons or even for leisure, with a range from basic 
			computer needs for school to also gaming PC's. With so many options in the market
			it can get very confusing for students to find a device that fits best for them, 
			that is why Student inc. was created, to facilitate and provide students with 
			efficient and reliable products and information.
